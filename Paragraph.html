    <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to work together on projects from anywhere. It is built on Git, a version control system that tracks changes in code, allowing users to manage and store different versions of their projects. GitHub provides a space for developers to host their repositories, share code, and collaborate on open-source projects. It offers tools for issue tracking, code review, and continuous integration, making it a powerful tool for both individual developers and teams working on software projects.</p>
